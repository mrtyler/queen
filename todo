bugs:
- some kind of transaction block so if Events don't get created, the
  Session doesn't either.
- on list pages, it's doing a query each time school_id shows up to get
  the name. precache this by fetching the table once at the beginning
  into an array, then referring to that array for the rest of the times.








features:
- lock tables when editing
