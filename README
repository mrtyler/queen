queen is a Ruby on Rails application I built in 2007-2008 to help me
manage after-school chess programs. Features include attendance
tracking, generation of flyers for advertising new classes, and rating
calculations for students.

This was my first RoR app so it is far from beautiful, and I was less
enlightened in those days so it does not have test coverage or data
migrations.

I also can't get it to run -- the machine where it used to live is now
in cold storage. There are numerous instances of people encountering the
error below, but no solutions:

    /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/rails-1.2.3/lib/initializer.rb:328:in
    `send': undefined method `session=' for ActionController::Base:Class
    (NoMethodError)

I tried a few things but nothing helped. If you have a burning desire to
see this code up and running, let me know and I'll spend some time
sorting it out.
